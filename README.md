## 🔷 Overview

This repository provides the implementation of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) based multi-objective scheduler designed for heterogeneous edge–cloud environments. The proposed framework dynamically balances latency, energy consumption, and SLA compliance using an adaptive reward mechanism.

### ✨ Key Features

- DQN-based intelligent scheduler  
- Adaptive multi-objective reward weighting  
- Edge–cloud unified state representation  
- Compatible with iFogSim 2.0 and CloudSim++  
- Reproducible experimental setup  
- Support for real and synthetic workloads
